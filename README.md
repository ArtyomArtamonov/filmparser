# Filmparser

## Description

Every time I want to watch a film, I have to go to baskino.me to check if it is available on torrent trackers to download it then. Filmparser does this automatically scrapping baskino.me and trying to find new added films by its original name on thepiratebay10.org

## Usage

Installation process is simple
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArtyomArtamonov/filmparser.git
cd bin
.\filmparser.exe
```

Output
```bash
